    "text": "I live in Zurich and work as a Risk Analyst with a focus on Combined Stress Testing in the Investment Banking division of UBS. My work revolves around modelling the evolution of the default probability of counterparties in the IB portfolio under stress scenarios and building analytic solutions to investigate core macroeconomic drivers and portfolio changes.\nOriginally from Athens, I finished my studies in Mechanical Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens, where I received my Master’s equivalent diploma in 2015. One year later I moved to Zurich to study Management and Economics at ETH and in 2017 I started working in the risk analytics space. Currently, I’m working in credit risk analytics focusing on combined stress testing.\nI started using the [R statistical language](https://www.r-project.org/) when working on my thesis at ETH to both analyse the data and apply a modeling strategy, as well as write the entire documentation. Since then I have enjoyed using it in my day to day work to implement solutions that can significantly improve my team’s efficiency and productivity on our various workflows. One of the purposes of this blog is to showcase tools to replace traditional software used in enterprises in order to automate common tasks and unlock potential for value creation. In fact, even this blog was built using R, Python and Quarto.\nWhen not working or doing other R related stuff, I enjoy watching movies and good animated shows, playing board or computer games with friends, and recently doing puzzles."
