## Hello there!!

I live in Zurich and work as a Quantitative Analyst with a focus on Combined Stress Testing models at UBS. Lately my work revolves around developing GenAI solutions and products using LangGraph and Azure OpenAI, while I am simultaneously the Product Owner for the Lombard & Retail Pod managing analytics for diverse portfolios.

I studied Mechanical Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens (M.Eng, 2015), before moving to Zurich a year later to complete my M.Sc. at ETH Zurich. Since 2018 I have worked at various roles in the Risk and Data Science space and have gained experience across portfolios and models in the Investment Banking, Personal & Corporate and Global Wealth Management divisions.

I have been programming all the way back to my university studies and have settled to use Python and R for most of my work and day-to-day needs. I have experience analyzing huge amounts of data, building and training ML and DL models, deploying them as APIs and overall crafting data products and solutions.

In the Portfolio section, I'll be showcasing projects touching upon different areas and uses of AI, aiming to present complete products, while in the Blog section I'll either walk through some projects or write about things I find interesting.

When not at work or busy with other data-related projects, I enjoy watching movies and good animated shows, hiking, playing board games, and recently working on LEGO sets.
