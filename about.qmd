## Hello there!!

I live in Zurich and work as a Risk Analyst with a focus on Combined Stress Testing models for the the Investment Banking division of UBS. My work revolves around modelling the evolution of the default probability of counterparties in the IB portfolio under stress scenarios and building analytical solutions to investigate core macroeconomic drivers and portfolio changes.

Originally from Athens, I finished my studies in Mechanical Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens, where I received my Master's equivalent diploma in 2015. One year later I moved to Zurich to study Management and Economics at ETH and in 2017 I started working in the risk analytics space.

I started using the [R statistical language](https://www.r-project.org/) when working on my thesis at ETH to both analyse the data and apply a modeling strategy, as well as write the entire documentation. For the last couple of years, I have also been programming in [Python](https://www.python.org/), particularly with a focus on data manipulation and modelling. I have enjoyed using both languages in my day to day work to implement solutions that can significantly improve my team's efficiency and productivity on our various workflows.

One of the purposes of this blog is to showcase tools to replace traditional software used in enterprises in order to automate common tasks and unlock potential for value creation. In fact, even this blog was built using R, Python and Quarto.

When not at work or busy with other data-related projects, I enjoy watching movies and good animated shows, hiking, planning trips to new destinations with friends, playing board games with friends, and recently doing puzzles.
